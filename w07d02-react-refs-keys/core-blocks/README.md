# Filterable React list 

## Release 0

Create a Filterable React list such that if we type any text the list will be filtered accordingly with case-insensitive i.e., the list will display only those items that will match the text

## Release 1 

Create two input fields using react components where 

- one is for adding new item in the list(which you have already done in the ToDo app)
- another is for filtering the list using the text we have entered in this field

## Release 2

Style the application. This time use external `.css` and include it in your components.
